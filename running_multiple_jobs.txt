running multiple jobs in diffrent different nodes.
jenkins 
creating two nodes :
manage jenkins ---> Manage Nodes --> only keep the master node 
node means a separate entity where the whole configuration can be  similaar kind of configurations are there and 
same kind of stuffs can be created in that particular instance .
In this kind of scenario we can have three different machines .
or in the same machine we can create three different environment in which the jobs will run parallely .
so if we want many jobs to run in parallel then we can do that by running them on nodes.
creating three different instances :
Manage Jenkins ---> Manage Nodes ---> New Node --> give descripiton ---> number of executors 
--> provide the remote directory .--> labels we can also give a new identification to the node 
---> Usage --> Launch Method(decides for launching agent agents via SSH/launch agent by connecting it to teh master node)
--> Availability --> Node Properties 
ways of connecting the agent to jenkins through on the se ways:
1) Launch agent from browser .
2) Run from agent command line .

java -jar agent.jar -jnlpurl
creting and making sure in which node we are goign to run the job .

restrict where the project can be run .
new item --> post build options if we do not provide the name of teh slave it will by default run on the master slave .
parallel nodes is must required for the bigger jobs to run . because if we run a job that takes 3 hrs and 
we are not able to run the other ones then we need the parallel nodes to run the jobs .
